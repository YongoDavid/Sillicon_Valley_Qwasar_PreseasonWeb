# Welcome to My Spaceship
***

## Task
Create a function that takes in a flight path of a rocket ship as a string of letters and returns the following format:
"{x: X, y: Y, direction: 'DIRECTION'}"
X,Y represent the ending coordinates of the ship and direction represents its final direction.

## Description
Once given this initial flight path, my program must return the x,y coordinates of a ship’s final destination 
as well as it’s orientation relative to the starting point.
Orientation is represented as left, right, up or down.


## Installation
Fork this project from my github repo or download it as a zip file and open it directly on your local machine

## Usage
This simulator creates a virtual “space” and keeps track of the basic movements and direction of a given ship. Your job is to keep track of where the ship is and it’s orientation relative to its starting point.
it  must take in a string of letters that represent a planned flight path for a given rocket ship.
In a ship’s flight path there are only 3 valid options for movement; R for turning right, L for turning left and A for advancing.
